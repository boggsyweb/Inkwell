    header: "Why should I hire a professional Bookkeeper?",
    panel: "A bookkeeper is responsible for managing your company's financial records, freeing you up to focus on your core operations. We keep track of transactions, organize expenses, help you prepare budgets, can run your payroll, and ensure that your accounts are accurate and up-to-date. We also make sure you are prepared for tax time and other critical deadlines. With a bookkeeper on board, you will always have access to precise and current financial data, enabling you to make informed business decisions."
  },
  {
    header: "Do you do taxes?",
    panel: "No, I am not an accountant or CPA. I cannot prepare your returns, nor can advise you on your federal, state, or local tax obligations. I can however, make sure your books are ready to hand off to your accountant, making tax time as easy as possible. I am also happy to work alongside your accountant or other tax professional, answering questions and providing necessary details about your operations."

  {
    header: "What types of businesses do you work with?",
    panel: "I love working with all types of small and medium-sized businesses! Some current clients include content-creators, business consultants, ecommerce stores, real estate investors, artists, and more."

  {
    header: "Do I have to have Quickbooks Online to work with you?",
    panel: "While I can work with other accounting platforms, my preference is to set up and migrate my clients to Quickbooks Online. As a Quickbooks ProAdvisor, I can offer extensive training to my clients. Some clients even qualify for significant discounts on their Quickbooks subscriptions when working with a ProAdvisor! ProAdvisors are also required to re-qualify every year to ensure they stay current with any changes to the platform. Because we also have access to exclusive support from Quickbooks, the up-to-date and accurate information we can pass along to clients is unparalleled."
  },
  {
    header: "How much do you charge?",
    panel: "The amount I charge varies greatly, depending on the scope of the work you hire me to do. That said, my minimum monthly fee starts at $100 for new and very small businesses and goes up from there. For one-time services like clean-ups, the rate will be tallied based on the estimated hours needed to complete the job. I am always transparent and up front about pricing and will work with you to find you the best solution for your budget."

  {
    header: "Why do I need an accountant and a bookkeeper?",
    panel: "A bookkeeper is responsible for keeping track of your day-to-day transactions, including reconciling your accounts, providing financial reports, helping you create budgets, and running payroll. An accountant can offer financial advice, help you create a tax strategy, and completes your taxes. While the two roles sometimes overlap, it is a good idea to work with both, so you know that all aspects of your businessâ€™s finances are well taken care of."
  },
  {
    header: "My books are a mess! What do I do?",
    panel: "Don't worry about it. The ongoing task of bookkeeping is one of the first things that tends to fall through the cracks when a business owner starts getting busy. I can offer clean up and catch up services to make sure your books are error-free, accurate, and up-to-date. I will also make sure you are trained and prepared to take care of your books in the future, and/or I can provide ongoing management for you."
  },
  {
    header: "Do you only provide remote services?",
    panel: "I choose to work fully remotely, so I am able to provide services to a number of clients across the US (and even US businesses based overseas!). Using email, phone calls, Zoom, etc., I can provide consistent support and meet with you at regular intervals."
  },
  {
    header: "Since you're remote, how do I get my documents to you?",
    panel: "Most bank and credit card statements can be set up to automatically upload to a client's Quickbooks account. Other sensitive financial and personal information can be uploaded into a client's Quickbooks account directly, or I can provide a secure and encrypted portal. Less sensitive documents like receipts can be sent through email, sms, and of course through Quickbooks Online."
