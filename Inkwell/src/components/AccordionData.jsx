I can however, make sure your books are ready to hand off to your accountant, making tax time as easy as possible. I am also happy to work alongside your acocountant or other tax professional, answering questions and providing necessary details about your operations."

    header: "What types of businesses do you work with?",
    panel: "I love working with all types of small and medium-sized businesses! Some current clients include content-creators, business consultants, ecommerce stores, real estate investors, artists, and more. At this time however, I do not provide services to lawyers or medical practices: These industries have specific needs that fall outside of my areas of expertise."

    header: "Do I have to have Quickbooks Online to work with you?",

ProAdvisors are also required to re-qualify every year to ensure they are current with any changes to the platform. They also have access to esclusive support from Quickbooks, which will make your experience as a client even better."
